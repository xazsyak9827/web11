		<td colspan="2">With an estimated world population of 111000 giraffes 
		many people do not see these creatures as endangered. There are four 
		distinct species of giraffe with several sub-species. The species are 
		the Masai giraffe, Northern giraffe, Reticulated giraffe and Southern 
		giraffe. The Luangwa giraffe (sometimes called the Thornicroft's 
		giraffe) have an estimated population of only 650 and are critically 
		endangered as are the West African giraffe with an estimated population 
		of 600. This is one of three sub-species of Northern giraffe, with each 
		being classified as endangered or critically endangered. There are fewer 
		than 3000 Northern giraffes remaining. We have arranged a programme to 
		rescue injured or orphaned giraffes, feed them and provide them with 
		medical care until they can be safely released back into the wild with 
		others of the same sub-species. Please support us in our work.</td>
